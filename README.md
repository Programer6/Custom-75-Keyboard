# Wireless 75% Keyboard

This is the documentation for  designed completely from scratch.

For the firmware, I chose ZMK. Since this is a wireless build using the `nice!nano`, ZMK's powerful features and Bluetooth support were a perfect fit, even if it meant a steeper learning curve than like KMK which I have used before.

# Hardware Features
- 74-key, 70% layout with a function row.
- Wireless Bluetooth connectivity via a `nice!nano` microcontroller.
- `MCP23017` I/O expander to simplify wiring and save controller pins.
- 1x Rotary Encoder for volume or scrolling.
- Onboard potentiometer for screen brightness adjustment.
- Powered by a LiPo battery.
